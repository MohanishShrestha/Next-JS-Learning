#Routing conventions 
1) All routes must live inside the app folder
2) Route files must be named either page.js or page.tsx
3) Each folder represents a segments of the URL path

when convetion are followed the file automatically becomes available as a routes

#folder name -> page.tsx   
ie profile-> page.tsx    
we can access it by http://localhost:3000/profile



#Nested routes
localhost:3000/profile
localhost:3000/profile/user1
folder name(profile) -> page.tsx  + folder1 + folder2 
folder1 (first)-> page.tsx
folder2 (second)-> page.tsx
ie profile-> page.tsx    
we can access it by http://localhost:3000/profile/first  => access first folder



#dynamic routes
folder name(profile) -> page.tsx  + [folder1] 
[folder1] -> page.tsx
localhost:3000/profile/1 


#nested dynamic routes
localhost:3000/product/1/review/1


#catch all segments 
here by using [...slug]-> page.tsx we can accept all URL
do[[...slug]] so that default can also be called
using this we can call multiple url 


#Not Found page
file name must be exactly not-Found in app
we can import the not-found ie import { notFound } from "next/navigation";and add notfound file here on folder and edit as we like
if we need to show different msg usePathname
to use we need to use client ie "use client" look at review not-found


#file colocation
we can saftly colocate file route segments in app directory without worrying them becoming Routing
we can also use external folder so it doesn't make routing



#private folder
- for internal stuff and Next js knows
- the folder and all its subfolders are excliided from Routing
- add an underscore at the start of the folder name ie _lib

useful for
- keeping your UI logic separate from routing logic
- Having a consistent way to organize internal files in yur project
- Making it easier to group related files in your code editor
- Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file naming conventions

if u want to actually want an underscore in your URL, use "%5F" instead, That's just
the URL-encoded version of an underscore

#Route groups
let us logically organize our routes nd project files without impacting the URL structure
 ie register, login, forgetPassword
