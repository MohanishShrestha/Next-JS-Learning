Routing conventions 
1) All routes must live inside the app folder
2) Route files must be named either page.js or page.tsx
3) Each folder represents a segments of the URL path

when convetion are followed the file automatically becomes available as a routes

folder name -> page.tsx   
ie profile-> page.tsx    
we can access it by http://localhost:3000/profile



Nested routes
localhost:3000/profile
localhost:3000/profile/user1
folder name(profile) -> page.tsx  + folder1 + folder2 
folder1 (first)-> page.tsx
folder2 (second)-> page.tsx
ie profile-> page.tsx    
we can access it by http://localhost:3000/profile/first  => access first folder
