#Routing conventions 
1) All routes must live inside the app folder
2) Route files must be named either page.js or page.tsx
3) Each folder represents a segments of the URL path

when convetion are followed the file automatically becomes available as a routes

#folder name -> page.tsx   
ie profile-> page.tsx    
we can access it by http://localhost:3000/profile



#Nested routes
localhost:3000/profile
localhost:3000/profile/user1
folder name(profile) -> page.tsx  + folder1 + folder2 
folder1 (first)-> page.tsx
folder2 (second)-> page.tsx
ie profile-> page.tsx    
we can access it by http://localhost:3000/profile/first  => access first folder



#dynamic routes
folder name(profile) -> page.tsx  + [folder1] 
[folder1] -> page.tsx
localhost:3000/profile/1 


#nested dynamic routes
localhost:3000/product/1/review/1


#catch all segments 
here by using [...slug]-> page.tsx we can accept all URL
do[[...slug]] so that default can also be called
using this we can call multiple url 


#Not Found page
file name must be exactly not-Found in app
we can import the not-found ie import { notFound } from "next/navigation";and add notfound file here on folder and edit as we like
if we need to show different msg usePathname
to use we need to use client ie "use client" look at review not-found


#file colocation
we can saftly colocate file route segments in app directory without worrying them becoming Routing
we can also use external folder so it doesn't make routing



#private folder
- for internal stuff and Next js knows
- the folder and all its subfolders are excliided from Routing
- add an underscore at the start of the folder name ie _lib

useful for
- keeping your UI logic separate from routing logic
- Having a consistent way to organize internal files in yur project
- Making it easier to group related files in your code editor
- Avoiding potential naming conflicts with future Next.js file naming conventions

if u want to actually want an underscore in your URL, use "%5F" instead, That's just
the URL-encoded version of an underscore

#Route groups
let us logically organize our routes and project files without impacting the URL structure
 ie register, login, forgetPassword in (auth)


#layout
like header content footer
to create a layout export a react component from a layout.js or layout.tsx file
that component takes a children prop which Next.js will populate with your page content
header ra footer lai root ma rakhna layout.tsx ma garra jun page gaye ni hatdaina ani


#Nested layout
we can also add on different folder like on review folder


# Multiple root layouts
route group uses 
- organize our project structure without affecting URLs
- Apply layout selectively to specific parts of our app
see tutorial2 for example 
here we have put main layout file on each route group so that each have its own layout
also add atleast root or main page.tsx on the route group


# Routing meta data 
the metadata api in next is a prowerful feature that lets us define metadata foe each page 
metadata ensures our content looks great when its shared or indexed bt search engines
two ways to handle metadata in layout.tsx or page.tsx file:
- export a static metadata object
- export a dynamic generateMetadata function

Configuring metadata
Metadata rules
- Both layout.tsx and page.tsx can export metadata. layout metadata
  applies to all its pages, while page metadata is specific to that page
- Metadata follows a top-down order, starting the root level
- When metadata exists in multiple places along a route, they merge together,
  with page metadata overridding layout metadata for matching properties

look using inspect where title and meta data is shown
 note: deeper metadata take priority
